<h1>How It Works + Shout-outs</h1>

<p><i>Hover your computer mouse over the yellow writing to see the shout-out.</i></p>

<p><span title="Never!" style="background-color: yellow;">Rarely</span> have we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path. Those who do not recover are people who cannot or will not completely give themselves to this simple program, usually men and women who are constitutionally incapable of being honest with <span title="Not me!" style="background-color: yellow;">themselves</span>. There are such unfortunates. They are not at fault; they seem to have been born that way. They are naturally incapable of grasping and developing a manner of living which demands rigorous honesty. Their chances are less than average. There are those, too, who suffer from grave emotional and mental disorders, but many of them do recover if they have the capacity to be <span title="Liars!" style="background-color: yellow;">honest.</p>
<p>Our stories disclose in a general way what we used to be like, what happened, and what we are like now. If you have decided that you want what we have and are willing to go to any length to get it - then you are ready to take certain steps.</p>
<p>At some of these we <span title="Bawk bawk bawk! (Make a sound like a chicken)" style="background-color: yellow;">balked</span>. We thought that we could find an easier, softer way. But we could not. With all earnestness at our command, we <span style="background-color: yellow;" title="Pleeeeeeaaaassseee please pleeease pleaaase">beg</span> of you to be fearless and thorough from the very start. Some of us have tried to hold on to our old ideas and the result was <span title="Nils? Where is Nils?! / Neil" style="background-color: yellow;">nil</span> until we let go absolutely.</p>
<p>Remember that we deal with alcohol - cunning, baffling, <span title="Delicious! Expensive!" style="background-color: yellow;">powerful!</span> Without help it is too much for us. But there is One who has all power - that One is God. May you find him now.</p>
<p>Half measures availed us nothing. We stood at the turning point. We asked His protection and care with complete <span title="I'm feel abandoned!" style="background-color: yellow;">abandon.</p>
<p>Here are the steps we took, which are suggested as a program of recovery:</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><span title="ONE! ssshhh" style="background-color: yellow;">We</span> admitted we were powerless over alcohol - that our lives had become unmanageable.</li>
<li><span style="background-color: yellow;" title="TWO! ssshhh">Came</span> to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.</li>
<li><span style="background-color: yellow;" title="THREE! ssshhh">Made</span> a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him.</li>
<li><span style="background-color: yellow;" title="FIVE! ssshhh">Made</span> a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.</li>
<li><span style="background-color: yellow;" title="FOUR! ssshhh">Admitted</span> to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.</li>
<li><span style="background-color: yellow;" title="SIX! ssshhh">Were</span> entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.</li>
<li><span style="background-color: yellow;" title="SEVEN! ssshhh">Humbly</span> asked Him to remove our <span style="background-color: yellow;" title="In bed!">shortcomings.</span></li>
<li><span style="background-color: yellow;" title="EIGHT! ssshhh">Made</span> a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them <span style="background-color: yellow;" title="SAY 'NO' IN GERMAN!!!">all.</span></li>
<li><span style="background-color: yellow;" title="NINE! ssshhh">Made</span> direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them <span style="background-color: yellow;" title="or otters?">or others.</span></li>
<li><span style="background-color: yellow;" title="TEN! ssshhh">Continued</span> to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted <span style="background-color: yellow;" title="I'M SORRY JESSICA!!!">it.</span></li>
<li><span style="background-color: yellow;" title="ELEVEN! ssshhh">Sought</span> through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.</li>
<li><span style="background-color: yellow;" title="TWELVE! ssshhh">Having</span> had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all our <span style="background-color: yellow;" title="We can have affairs?!">affairs</span>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Many of us exclaimed, "What an order! I can't go through with it." Do not be <span style="background-color: yellow;" title="I'm discouraged!">discouraged.</span> No one among us has been able to maintain anything like perfect adherence to these principles. We are not <span style="background-color: yellow;" title="What's the point?">saints.</span> The point is, that we were willing to grow along spiritual <span style="background-color: yellow;" title="Good point.">lines.</span> The principles we have set down are guides to <span style="background-color: yellow;" title="Better point">progress.</span> We claim spiritual progress rather than spiritual <span style="background-color: yellow;" title="Best point.">perfection.</span></p>

<p>Our description of the alcoholic, the chapter to the agnostic, and our personal adventures before and after make clear three pertinent ideas:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li><span style="background-color: yellow;" title="One!">That</span> we were alcoholic and could not manage our own lives.</li>
<li><span style="background-color: yellow;" title="Two!">That</span> probably no human power could have relieved our <span style="background-color: yellow;" title="Say 'Yes' in Spanish!">alcoholism.</span></li>
<li>That God could and would if He were <span style="background-color: yellow;" title="There he is!">sought.</span></li>
</ol>
