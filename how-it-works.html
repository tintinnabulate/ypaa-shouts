<p><button class="tooltip">Rarely have<span class="tooltiptext">Never!</span></button> we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path.
  Those who do not recover are people who cannot or will not completely give themselves to this simple program, usually men and women who are 
  constitutionally incapable of being honest with <button class="tooltip">themselves<span class="tooltiptext">Not me!</span></button>. There are 
  such unfortunates. They are not at fault; they seem to have been born that way. They are naturally incapable of grasping and developing a 
  manner of living which demands rigorous honesty. Their chances are less than average. There are those, too, who suffer from grave emotional 
  and mental disorders, but many of them do recover if they have the capacity to 
  <button class="tooltip">be honest.<span class="tooltiptext">Liars!</span></button></p>
  
<p>Our stories disclose in a general way what we used to be like, what happened, and what we are like now. If you have decided that you want 
  what we have and are willing to go to any length to get it - then you are ready to take certain steps.</p>
<p>At some of these <button class="tooltip">we balked.<span class="tooltiptext">Bawk bawk bawk! üêî</span></button> 
  We thought that we could find an easier, softer way. But we could not. With all earnestness at our command,  
  <button class="tooltip">we beg<span class="tooltiptext">Pleaaase pleaaase pleaaase!</span></button> of you to be fearless and thorough 
  from the very start. Some of us have tried to hold on to our old ideas and 
  <button class="tooltip">the result was nil<span class="tooltiptext">Neil? Where are you, Neil?</span></button> until we let go absolutely.</p>
  
<p>Remember that we deal with alcohol - cunning,  
  <button class="tooltip">baffling, powerful!<span class="tooltiptext">Delicious! Expensive!</span></button>
  Without help it is too much for us. But there is One who has all power - that One is God. May you find him <button class="tooltip">now.<span class="tooltiptext">There he is!</span></button></p>
  
<p>Half measures availed us nothing. We stood at the turning point. We asked His protection and care with 
<button class="tooltip">complete abandon.<span class="tooltiptext">I feel abandoned!</span></button></p>
  
<p>Here are the steps we took, which are suggested as a program of recovery:</p>

<ol type="1">
    <li><button class="tooltip">We admitted<span class="tooltiptext">ONE! ssshhh</span></button> we were powerless over alcohol - that our lives had become unmanageable.</li>
    <li><button class="tooltip">Came to<span class="tooltiptext">TWO! ssshhh</span></button> believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.</li>
<li><button class="tooltip">Made a decision<span class="tooltiptext">THREE! ssshhh</span></button> to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him.</li>
<li><button class="tooltip">Made a searching<span class="tooltiptext">FIVE! ssshhh</span></button> and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.</li>
<li><button class="tooltip">Admitted to<span class="tooltiptext">FOUR! ssshhh</span></button> God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.</li>
<li><button class="tooltip">Were entirely<span class="tooltiptext">SIX! ssshhh</span></button> ready to have God remove all these defects of character.</li>
<li><button class="tooltip">Humbly asked<span class="tooltiptext">SEVEN! ssshhh</span></button> Him to remove <button class="tooltip">our shortcomings.<span class="tooltiptext">In bed!</span></button></li>
<li><button class="tooltip">Made a list<span class="tooltiptext">EIGHT! ssshhh</span></button> of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends <button class="tooltip">to them all<span class="tooltiptext">SAY NO IN GERMAN!!!</span></button></li>
<li>Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them <button class="tooltip">or others.<span class="tooltiptext">or otters?</span></button></li>
<li><button class="tooltip">Continued to<span class="tooltiptext">TEN! ssshhh</span></button> take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly <button class="tooltip">admitted it.<span class="tooltiptext">I'M SORRY JESSICAAAAA!!!</span></button></li>
<li><button class="tooltip">Sought through<span class="tooltiptext">ELEVEN! ssshhh</span></button> prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.</li>
<li><button class="tooltip">Having had<span class="tooltiptext">TWELVE! ssshhh</span></button> a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all <button class="tooltip">our affairs<span class="tooltiptext">We can have affairs?!</span></button>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Many of us exclaimed, "What an order! I can't go through with it." Do not <button class="tooltip">be discouraged.<span class="tooltiptext">I'm discouraged!</span></button> No one among us has been able to maintain anything like perfect adherence to these principles. We are <button class="tooltip">not saints.<span class="tooltiptext">What's the point?</span></button> The point is, that we were willing to grow along <button class="tooltip">spiritual lines.<span class="tooltiptext">Good point.</span></button> The principles we have set down are guides <button class="tooltip">to progress.<span class="tooltiptext">Better point.</span></button> We claim spiritual progress rather than spiritual <button class="tooltip">perfection.<span class="tooltiptext">Best point.</span></button></p>

<p>Our description of the alcoholic, the chapter to the agnostic, and our personal adventures before and after make clear three pertinent ideas:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li><button class="tooltip">That we<span class="tooltiptext">One!</span></button> were alcoholic and could not manage our own lives.</li>
<li><button class="tooltip">That probably<span class="tooltiptext">Two!</span></button> no human power could have relieved <button class="tooltip">our alcoholism.<span class="tooltiptext">Say 'Yes' in Spanish!</span></button></li>
<li>That God could and would if He were sought.</li>
