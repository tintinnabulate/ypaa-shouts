<p><span class="tooltip">Rarely<span class="tooltiptext">Never!</span></span> have we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path.
  Those who do not recover are people who cannot or will not completely give themselves to this simple program, usually men and women who are 
  constitutionally incapable of being honest with <span class="tooltip">themselves<span class="tooltiptext">Not me!</span></span>. There are 
  such unfortunates. They are not at fault; they seem to have been born that way. They are naturally incapable of grasping and developing a 
  manner of living which demands rigorous honesty. Their chances are less than average. There are those, too, who suffer from grave emotional 
  and mental disorders, but many of them do recover if they have the capacity to be 
  <span class="tooltip">honest.<span class="tooltiptext">Liars!</span></span></p>
  
<p>Our stories disclose in a general way what we used to be like, what happened, and what we are like now. If you have decided that you want 
  what we have and are willing to go to any length to get it - then you are ready to take certain steps.</p>
<p>At some of these we <span class="tooltip">balked.<span class="tooltiptext">Bawk bawk bawk! (Make a sound like a chicken)</span></span> 
  We thought that we could find an easier, softer way. But we could not. With all earnestness at our command, we 
  <span class="tooltip">beg<span class="tooltiptext">Pleaaase pleaaase pleaaase!</span></span> of you to be fearless and thorough 
  from the very start. Some of us have tried to hold on to our old ideas and the result was 
  <span class="tooltip">nil<span class="tooltiptext">Neil? Where are you, Neil?</span></span> until we let go absolutely.</p>
  
<p>Remember that we deal with alcohol - cunning, baffling, 
  <span class="tooltip">powerful!<span class="tooltiptext">Delicious! Expensive!</span></span>
  Without help it is too much for us. But there is One who has all power - that One is God. May you find him <span class="tooltip">now.<span class="tooltiptext">There he is!</span></span></p>
  
<p>Half measures availed us nothing. We stood at the turning point. We asked His protection and care with complete 
<span class="tooltip">abandon.<span class="tooltiptext">I feel abandoned!</span></span></p>
  
<p>Here are the steps we took, which are suggested as a program of recovery:</p>

<ol type="1">
    <li><span class="tooltip">We<span class="tooltiptext">ONE! ssshhh</span></span> admitted we were powerless over alcohol - that our lives had become unmanageable.</li>
    <li><span class="tooltip">Came<span class="tooltiptext">TWO! ssshhh</span></span> to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.</li>
<li><span class="tooltip">Made<span class="tooltiptext">THREE! ssshhh</span></span> a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him.</li>
<li><span class="tooltip">Made<span class="tooltiptext">FIVE! ssshhh</span></span> a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.</li>
<li><span class="tooltip">Admitted<span class="tooltiptext">FOUR! ssshhh</span></span> to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.</li>
<li><span class="tooltip">Were<span class="tooltiptext">SIX! ssshhh</span></span> entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.</li>
<li><span class="tooltip">Humbly<span class="tooltiptext">SEVEN! ssshhh</span></span> asked Him to remove our <span class="tooltip">shortcomings.<span class="tooltiptext">In bed!</span></span></li>
<li><span class="tooltip">Made<span class="tooltiptext">EIGHT! ssshhh</span></span> a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them <span class="tooltip">all<span class="tooltiptext">SAY NO IN GERMAN!!!</span></span></li>
<li><span class="tooltip">Made<span class="tooltiptext">NINE! ssshhh</span></span> direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them <span class="tooltip">or others.<span class="tooltiptext">or otters?</span></span></li>
<li><span class="tooltip">Continued<span class="tooltiptext">TEN! ssshhh</span></span> to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted <span title="tooltip">it.<span class="tooltiptext">I'M SORRY JESSICAAAAA!!!</span></span></li>
<li><span class="tooltip">Sought<span class="tooltiptext">ELEVEN! ssshhh</span></span> through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.</li>
<li><span class="tooltip">Having<span class="tooltiptext">TWELVE! ssshhh</span></span> had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all our <span class="tooltip">affairs<span class="tooltiptext">We can have affairs?!</span></span>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Many of us exclaimed, "What an order! I can't go through with it." Do not be <span class="tooltip">discouraged.<span class="tooltiptext">I'm discouraged!</span></span> No one among us has been able to maintain anything like perfect adherence to these principles. We are not <span class="tooltip">saints.<span class="tooltiptext">What's the point?</span></span> The point is, that we were willing to grow along spiritual <span class="tooltip">lines.<span class="tooltiptext">Good point.</span></span> The principles we have set down are guides to <span class="tooltip">progress.<span class="tooltiptext">Better point.</span></span> We claim spiritual progress rather than spiritual <span class="tooltip">perfection.<span class="tooltiptext">Best point.</span></span></p>

<p>Our description of the alcoholic, the chapter to the agnostic, and our personal adventures before and after make clear three pertinent ideas:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li><span class="tooltip">That<span class="tooltiptext">One!</span></span> we were alcoholic and could not manage our own lives.</li>
<li><span class="tooltip">That<span class="tooltiptext">Two!</span></span> probably no human power could have relieved our <span class="tooltip">alcoholism.<span class="tooltiptext">Say 'Yes' in Spanish!</span></span></li>
<li>That God could and would if He were <span class="tooltip">sought.<span class="tooltiptext">There he is!</span></span></li>
</ol>
