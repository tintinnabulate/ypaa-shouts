<li>Our common welfare should come first; personal recovery depends upon A.A. <button class="tooltip">unity.<span class="tooltiptext">uni-teeeeeeeee!!!</span></button></li>

<li>For our group purpose, there is but one ultimate authorityâ€”a loving God as He may express Himself in our group conscience. Our leaders are <button class="tooltip">but trusted servants<span class="tooltiptext">BUTT TRUSTED!</span></button>; they do not govern.</li>

<li>The only requirement for A.A. membership is a desire to <button class="tooltip">stop drinking.<span class="tooltiptext">and a boat!</span></button></li>

<li>Each group should be autonomous except in matters affecting other groups or A.A. <button class="tooltip">as a whole.<span class="tooltiptext">A-HOLE!</span></button></li>

<li>Each group has but one primary purpose: to carry its message to the alcoholic <button class="tooltip">who still suffers.<span class="tooltiptext">I'M DYIN' OVER HERE!</span></button></li>

<li>An A.A. group ought never endorse, finance, or lend the A.A. name to any related facility or outside enterprise, lest problems of money, property, and prestige divert us from our <button class="tooltip">primary purpose.<span class="tooltiptext">PRIMARY PORPOISE!</span></button></li>

<li>Every A.A. group ought to be fully self-supporting, declining outside contributions.</li>

<li>Alcoholics Anonymous should remain forever non-professional, but our service centers may employ special workers.</li>

<li>A.A., as such, ought never be organized; but we may create service boards or committees directly responsible to those they serve.</li>

<span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"></span><li>Alcoholics Anonymous has no opinion on outside issues; hence the A.A. name ought never be drawn into public controversy.</li>

<li>Our public relations policy is based on <button class="tooltip">attraction<span class="tooltiptext">*whistle*</span></button> rather than promotion; we need always maintain personal anonymity at the level of <button class="tooltip">press, radio, and films.<span class="tooltiptext">Grindr! Tinder! E-harmony!</span></button></li>

<li>Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our traditions, ever reminding us to place principles above personalities.</li>
